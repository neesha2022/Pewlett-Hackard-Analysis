# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Purpose: 
To determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We used ERD as the reference and created the following tables:
* Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 
* Retrieve the number of titles from the Unique Titles table.
*  Mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

## Results:
Few observations:
* There are 300024 employees out of which 41380 born between'1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31' and the hire date was between '1985-01-01' AND '1988-12-31'

## Summary:
While there is a high number of employees with retirement, there are 70947 employees eligible for the mentorship program.  The company should invest in the mentorship program to train the eligibile employees and have a roll out plan for filling in the senior titles.
