## Purpose: 
To determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We used ERD as the reference and created the following tables:
* Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 
* Retrieve the number of titles from the Unique Titles table.
*  Mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

## Results:

* There are 300024 employees out of which 41380 born between'1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31' and the hire date was between '1985-01-01' AND '1988-12-31'

* We created the unique titles table showing most recent title for employees of retirment age. There 90398 employees.

* There are 90398 are with retiring titles with 44775 (44775/90398 = 49.24%) with Senior titles.

* There are 70947 (70947/300024 = 23.64 %)employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
